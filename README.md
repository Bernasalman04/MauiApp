# .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) - Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework! .NET MAUI is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps using C# and XAML. With .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with .NET MAUI, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

1. [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
2. [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [MAUI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NET-Multi-platform-App-UI.MauiExtension) installed.

## Creating a new .NET MAUI project

To create a new .NET MAUI project, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code.
2. Select "Create a new project".
3. Search for ".NET MAUI" and choose the appropriate project template based on your desired platform (Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows).
4. Provide a name and location for your project.
5. Click "Create" to generate the project files.

## Developing with .NET MAUI

Once you have created a .NET MAUI project, you can start developing your app using C# and XAML. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- .NET MAUI is an open-source framework that extends Xamarin.Forms from mobile to desktop scenarios.
- The UI controls in .NET MAUI have been rebuilt from the ground up for better performance and extensibility.
- You can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can also add platform-specific code and resources if needed.
- The goal of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.

## Building and Running the App

To build and run your .NET MAUI app, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have selected the appropriate target platform (e.g., Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows) in your development environment.
2. Build the project to compile your code and generate the necessary binaries.
3. Run the app on an emulator, simulator, or physical device based on your selected platform.
